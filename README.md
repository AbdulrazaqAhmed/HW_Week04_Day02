# What you'll build 📋
## A polished Affirmations app that uses a `RecyclerView` to display a list of cards. Each card contains an image and affirmation text.

## You will display the text and image for each affirmation within a card, using the `MaterialCardView` widget from the Material Components for Android library. Then you will finish the app by polishing the UI to create a more cohesive and beautiful user experience. This is a screenshot of the completed app:
